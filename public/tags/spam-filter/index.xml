      <description>visit https://oopspam.com/ I was thinking about some ideas as a side-project. Well, I thought it would be nice to pass my project-based exams Mobile Applications and Cloud Computing, Human-Computer Interaction with the same idea. I came up with the idea of VirusTotal-like service but as a spam filter service. As a result, OOPSpam API came to light. After making a few research I found out there is actually well-developed solution like mine, however, the price seemed to be high.</description>
