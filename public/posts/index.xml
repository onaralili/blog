      <description>I have decided to publish materials I wrote for my Computer and Network Security course. It could help someone out there, so why keep it on my hard drive. You can obviously get shorter and straightforward information from following Wikipedia page. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol

      <description>visit https://oopspam.com/ I was thinking about some ideas as a side-project. Well, I thought it would be nice to pass my project-based exams Mobile Applications and Cloud Computing, Human-Computer Interaction with the same idea. I came up with the idea of VirusTotal-like service but as a spam filter service. As a result, OOPSpam API came to light. After making a few research I found out there is actually well-developed solution like mine, however, the price seemed to be high.</description>
