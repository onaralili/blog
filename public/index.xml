      <description>This is a short story and malware analysis of a chrome extension that served people well then the developer sell it to the malicious advertisement company.
Discovery As you may know, recently I have published an extension (yes! one more tab manager for the world) SplitUp! - Tab Manager. I was looking for a way to improve it and Chrome Web Store is a great place to see other extensions to get inspired for new ideas.</description>

      <description>I have decided to publish materials I wrote for my Computer and Network Security course. It could help someone out there, so why keep it on my hard drive. You can obviously get shorter and straightforward information from following Wikipedia page. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol
So, what is it? The Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol is a great method for securing remote access to many applications. It has been developed by Thomas Wu at Stanford University to enable the secure authentication based on username and password.</description>

      <description>visit https://oopspam.com/ I was thinking about some ideas as a side-project. Well, I thought it would be nice to pass my project-based exams Mobile Applications and Cloud Computing, Human-Computer Interaction with the same idea. I came up with the idea of VirusTotal-like service but as a spam filter service. As a result, OOPSpam API came to light. After making a few research I found out there is actually well-developed solution like mine, however, the price seemed to be high.</description>
