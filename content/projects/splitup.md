title: "SplitUp! - open multiple tabs in a new window "
description: "This is a Google Chrome extension to separate one or many tabs into a different window. I developed SplitUp! in a day for my own purposes, it is handy when I'm studying and opened tons of websites and here the extension makes life easier. Just choosing from the list and splitting some websites into a different window."
