title: "HipMyTrip! - an artistic travel map for your trip"
description: "My partner and I collaborated on this project. I did the website, payment integration with Braintree as well as the backend for payment processing with Node.js and Restify. 
A little bit about the project, have you ever traveled somewhere with a someone special and wanted to give that special person a memorable gift as a reminder of your trip? Using the website you can order a beautiful, artistic, handmade map of your trip. Check https://hipmytrip.com/ to see what I meant. It really looks pretty on the wall ðŸ—ºâœ¨. "
