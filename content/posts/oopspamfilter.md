I was thinking about some ideas as a side-project. Well, I thought it would be nice to pass my project-based exams Mobile Applications and Cloud Computing, Human-Computer Interaction with the same idea. I came up with the idea of VirusTotal-like service but as a spam filter service. As a result, OOPSpam API came to light. After making a few research I found out there is actually well-developed solution like mine, however, the price seemed to be high. I started development by integrating a few major spam filer services such as Apache SpamAssassin and deployed the application to Heroku. Roughly, this is how it works:

### So, what is it?

It is a multiple spam filter service that has built-in integration with powerful machine learning and text analyzers. It takes a content as an input and sends it to various spam filter services and returns the likelihood of the content to be a spam.
Integration is quite simple, the only thing you have to do is to send a request to
```url
https://oopspam.herokuapp.com 
```

with JSON object :
{{< highlight json >}}
{"text":"The example content!"}
{{< /highlight >}}

As a result, you will be responded with JSON object as following :

{{< highlight json >}}
{
"spam": 2,
"nospam": 1
}
{{< /highlight >}}

As obvious it might seem It is worth to mention that **spam** and **nospam** stand for a number of services that recognized the content as a spam/not spam.

Iâ€™m planning to integrate other providers as well to make it even accurate. The project can be helpful for the folks who want to protect users from the spam contents.
